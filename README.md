# IRCTC Online Ticket Booking Automation

## Project Overview 
This project showcases an advanced train booking automation system built using Selenium WebDriver. The system automates the end-to-end booking process on the IRCTC platform, including train selection, dynamic drop-down handling, CAPTCHA solving using Tesseract OCR, and ticket booking. The project emphasizes efficiency, reliability, and scalability, with significant improvements in booking accuracy and reduced manual effort.

## Setup For Running Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Selenium automation project:

1.Clone the Repository

#### Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/rajkumardubey10/Python_Automation_selenium.git
```
      
#### Enter into directory:
```
cd Python_Automation_selenium
```
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
   
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # For Windows
```
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the following environment variables for secure credential storage:
```
USER_NAME=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
```
5. Download WebDriver
Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
Place the WebDriver executable in a directory included in your system's PATH.

6. Run the Automation Script
Execute the script using Python:
```
python automation_script.py
```
7. Log Output
Check the console or log files for detailed outputs and error messages.
Logs are automatically created to help debug and monitor the script’s execution.

8. View Test Cases
Test cases are documented in the `test_cases.xlsx` file for review and validation.
